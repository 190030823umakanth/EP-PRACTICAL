Intoduction to AI
ai-man made + thinking power
it is a branch of cs by which we can create intellgent machine which can behave like and think like a human and able to make decision
->u do not need to pre program the machine for some work 
-> we should create a machine with programmed algorithm and  which it can take a own decission


Application of AI:
                  fianances
                  hospital
                  transport
                  education
                  business
                  defence
                  banking
                  securities
                  fuzzy logic


NLP Stands for:Natural language process it is a part of computer science and human  lanaguage and aritificial intelligences .it is a techonogy use by machines 

AI- is also define as study of rational agent its environment
the agent scence the enivirnoment
there are three types of agents
->human agent-eyess ears andd other organs are the sesors,hands and legs are works for actutors etc
 
->robotic agent-cameras infrared range 

->s/w agent-key strokes,cell phone 

1)SENSORS- it isa device which detects the change in the environment and sends the information to other electronic device  
-->AN agent observes the environment throught sensor 
2)ACTUATORS-it is a component of machine that converts energy into motion
            -moving controlling system

3) effectors - which affects the environment it can be legs,arms fingers and display screen



types of AI agents
 agents can be grouped into five classes based on their degree of perceived intelligence capacity
 ->simple reflex agent
 ->model based reflex agent
 ->goal based agent
 ->utility based agent
 ->learning agent -
                   Learing element
                   critic
                   performance element
                   problem generation 
Simple reflex agent-this agent works only on the basis of current preception and it does not bother about p
pevious state in which the system was
this type of agent id based upon the condition-action-rule
if the condition is true
        action is taken
            else not
Utility based agent-based agent act not only goals but also the best way to achieve the goal


Aggent environment in AI
   An environment is everything in the world which surrounded the agent but it is not a part of an agent it
   ->an environment can be described as a situation in an agent is present
Features of Environment
   An environment can have various features from the point view of an  agent 
       1) fully observable vs partially observable
       2) static vs dynamic
       3) Discrete vs continous
       4) Determinstics vs stochastic
       5) single agent vs multi agent
       6) episodic vs sequential
       7) known vs unknown
       8) accessible vs In accessible


SEARCHING ALGORITHMS
      there are two types of searching algorithms 
      1) uninformed algorithm-it does not uses any domain knowledge and and didd not know any more information about the problem
         and it operates in a brute force way as it include information about how to traverse th etree and how to identify leaf and goal include
               types of uninformed search (blind search)-
                                      breadth first search
                                      uniform cost search
                                      depth first search
                                      depth limited search
                                      iteraative depping depth first search
                                      Bidirectional search algorithm
      2) informed algorithm-it uses domain knowledge and it have a full of information and know the how the goal was and know how to do the sol are more efficent
         than an uninformed it is also callled as heuristic search and it might not always give guarantee for the best sol but guaranteed to find a good slo in reasonable time
                types of informed search (heuristic search)-
                                      best first searc h
                                      A* search
                                      AO* algorithm
                                      problem reducing
                                      hill climbing
